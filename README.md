# HelloPlugin
This is the first plugin I ever created.This is a really simple plugin which greets a player in minecraft
# What is it
I've just created this plugin in 5 minutes and what it does is greets a player for example the player name is ExplodingMan so if the player does /hello   it will show the message you configured in the config as an output
# Commands
/hello : It replies to player with greeting!      
/hello reload : Reloads the config.
# Permissions
hello.reload : Permission to reload the config!
